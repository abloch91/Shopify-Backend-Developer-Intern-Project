# Shopify-Backend-Developer-Intern-Project


Project Introduction

This is my submission for the Shopify Fall 2022 Backend Developer Internship Challenge.  I have created an inventory tracking application for a company called AMB Logistics.  This application has the capability to create inventory items, edit them, delete them and view a list of them.  Additionally, I have added a feature that gives you the ability to create locations and assign inventory to specific locations.
